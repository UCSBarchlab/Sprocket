# âš™ Sprocket

Sprocket is a small unikernel written in Rust and x86 assembly.  The goal of
Sprocket was to create a simplified operating system to explore how Rust's
safety guarantees could be applied to low-level systems development.  By
analyzing the use of unsafe code in Sprocket, we hope to determine common
patterns of how unsafe code is used, and improve the safety of the operating
system through proposed hardware and software mechanisms.
